        <h3>How might we bring a greater immediacy to our discussions about diversity and inclusion?</h3>
        <p>Tech has a diversity and inclusion problem: this is not news. As an engineer at Microsoft, I have borne witness to a variety of attempts to improve these issues. Most of the attempts are well-intentioned, and I have enjoyed many of them: the talks and trainings, the brainstorming sessions, the panels with leadership. What I noticed, though, was the way these discussions felt so abstract to many of my peers. There was little empathic motivation behind them. There was a lot of talk about how to fix the problems without a real shared understanding of what the problems were.</p>
        <p>A small group of us wondered whether an experience-based activity, something that pushed participants beyond their comfort zone but did so in a safe environment, could address this gap. To test this hypothesis, we needed an activity that:</p>
        <div class="pullquote-wrapper">
        <aside class="pullquote">We created a training disguised as an escape room.</aside>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <p><li><p>focused on <em>all three</em> tenets of diversity, inclusion, and belonging,</p></li></p>
            <li><p>was interactive for all participants,</p></li>
            <li><p>caused people to have an authentic emotional experience,</p></li>
            <li><p>encouraged and developed teamwork, and</p></li>
            <li><p>opened participants up to a meaningful discussion.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>With these principles in mind, we created a training disguised as an escape room. We built and tested the experience over a single week, during a team hackathon in March 2019.</p>

        <h3>Why an escape room?</h3>
        <p>We chose the escape room format in large part because we thought it would be fun, and because we thought it would appeal to our puzzle-minded engineering colleagues. It was important that the activity be competitive and absorbing: this would parallel our real-life work environment, where individuals are focused on challenging tasks and often face the pressure of tight deadlines. In this type of high-focus situation, interpersonal relationships and communication can suffer, and exclusion can occur even without bad intent.</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.2em"><b>The Room</b></p>
        <p>The experience is designed for a group of 5-7 people. After a brief introduction, all participants, except one, are led into the escape room. The room’s “theme” is a typical Microsoft meeting. When the group enters the escape room for the first time, it looks, for the most part, like an average conference room: sticky notes on the whiteboard, a donut box on the back counter. On the projector screen, a timer starts counting down.</p>
        <p>One of the teammates doesn’t enter the room with the rest. They remain in an adjacent room and have to participate remotely, via a Microsoft Teams call. Their teammates can hear them, but not see them. This remote team member can see a limited view of the room through the conference room’s built-in camera. The group’s first goal is to complete a set of tasks to bring their remote teammate into the room.</p>

        <br />
        <p style="font-size:1.2em"><b>The Twist</b></p>
        <p>Before entering the room, each participant gets a unique rule to follow for the duration of the activity. The rules affect how each person is allowed to communicate. Some rules add mental processing time, requiring the participant to think carefully about what they say before they say it. Some require participants to be physically removed from some or all of their teammates. And some of the rules work in confluence, simulating in-group/out-group dynamics within the team.</p>
        <p>None of the rules are meant to represent any specific individual or group of people. Rather, they help raise emotional responses. How does it feel to be part of the out-group? How does it feel to not be fully heard?</p>
        <div class="standard-image">

        </div>
        <div id="desk-caption" class="caption">Desk setup for "remote" team member.</div>
        <p>The full experience (puzzles + rules) is designed such that it is easier to complete the challenge when:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Everyone works to find <b>the best way to communicate with each of their teammates</b></p></li>
            <li><p><b>The group accommodates the needs of the individual</b>, rather than the individual trying to change themselves (or their rule) to accommodate the group</p></li>
            <li><p>Diverse perspectives are <b>present</b> and <b>consulted</b></p></li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <div class="pullquote-wrapper">
        <aside class="pullquote">Some of them explain how they felt excluded or frustrated. Some of them realize how easy it is to be the one doing the excluding.</aside>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em"><b>The Debrief</b></p>
        <p>Once the group completes the set of puzzles and unlocks the final safe, we transition into a guided discussion about what they just experienced and how it relates to the day-to-day life of their workgroup. Participants share what their rules were, how their rules made them feel, and what types of interactions they noticed within the room. Many admit that they weren’t paying much attention to their teammates at all: they were single-mindedly focused on completing the task at hand.</p>
        <p>It’s rewarding to watch the group transition in their thinking over the course of this discussion. Often they start out giddy: they’ve just been through a slightly uncomfortable (but overall fun) ordeal, they feel victorious, they want to talk about which puzzles they liked or disliked. As they reflect together, though, they realize that they actually experienced something deeper. Some of them explain how they felt excluded or frustrated. Some of them realize how easy it is to be the one doing the excluding.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>As of September 2019, the Escape Room for Diversity and Inclusion has been experienced by 145 Microsoft employees of varying disciplines, teams, and levels.</p>
        <p>We collected two sets of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>one survey sent the day after the participant went through the room, to gauge initial reactions and learnings, and</p></li>
            <li><p>one survey sent a month later, to measure lasting effects.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initial results indicate that after doing the training, participants felt better equipped to identify exclusive behaviors in their everyday lives. They also felt closer to the teammates they went through the experience with.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="envelopes-caption" class="caption">Special instructions for each team member.</div>
        <p>Verbatims from the surveys express a broad enthusiasm for the training, and a desire to make it more widely available. The following is a small selection:</p>
        <p class="inline-quote">“It was eye-opening to see how quickly we exclude teammates with different behaviors or abilities when we're focused on a task. The exercise was a <b>great reminder that we need to be more inclusive at work</b> and that this will actually help us solve problems.”</p>
        <p class="inline-quote">“The puzzles were fun but I think my biggest takeaway was the <b>challenge of working across differences</b> and the nature of collaboration with others who are different from me.”</p>
        <p class="inline-quote">“It was a really great experience where until the final discussion I did not fully understand how the activity was related to D/I. During the final discussion it was like <b>a mindblowing revelation when I realized how different aspects of the game was super relevant to day to day activities</b>, interactions between people (not just at work) and how it can impact someone's experience.”</p>
        <p class="inline-quote">“The experience <b>got me to think more about how we work with our remote partner teams</b> and how we should make an effort to reach out.”</p>
        <p class="inline-quote">“I think <b>everyone on my team who has gone through it will be a little bit better because of it.</b>”</p>

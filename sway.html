            <p class="primary-info"><em>The following reflects my personal point of view and does not represent the views of Microsoft.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p><a href="https://sway.office.com">Sway</a>, part of the Microsoft Office suite, is a web application for creating engaging, interactive, web-based presentations that look good on any device. I've worked on several features in my two years as a software engineer on the product, most of them central to the user experience of creating Sways. This feature, which I helped identify the need for, prototype, and ship, solved a common usability issue in the app.</p>
        <p><em>Note: All thoughts are my own, and do not represent an official statement by Microsoft.</em></p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>One of the things that users love most about Sway is the ability to search for images and videos without leaving the app. While creating a Sway, you can click the “insert” button and a pane pops out, filled with images and videos from the web. It used to look like this:</p>
         <div class="standard-image">
            <img alt="The Sway interface without content filtering" src="resources/acp-before.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>After running a study on <a href="https://usertesting.com">usertesting.com</a> to identify usability pitfalls in the Sway creation experience, we found that users had a difficult time telling the difference between an image and a video in the content pane, and knowing where they could drag and drop each onto the authoring surface.</p>
        <div class="pullquote-wrapper">
        <aside class="pullquote">The user would keep trying to drag a video into the title card and wonder why it wouldn't stay there.</aside>
        </div>
        <p>Often, the first piece of content users try to add to their Sway is a background image on their title card. The title card only allows an image to be dropped into it, not a video. But the video thumbnails in the content pane look similar to the images. When a user tried to add a video (that they thought was an image) to their title card, the content wouldn't stick in the title background spot, and would instead jump below the title, creating a new video card. At this point it was still unclear that the content was a video, and the user would keep trying to drag it into the title card and wonder why it wouldn't stay there. The experience was incredibly frustrating.</p>
        <p>Telemetry told us that in about 20% of Sways, a video was the first piece of content a user added. We hypothesized a large portion of these videos were added by mistake, and that once we made the experience more clear, this percentage would decrease.</p>
        <h3>The solution</h3>
        <p>There were many possible ways to solve this problem, but the solution we decided on was one we believed could help us make big usability gains in a short amount of time.</p>
        <div class="pullquote-wrapper">
        <aside class="pullquote">The filters show the type of media that the user is most likely to want to add next.</aside>
        </div>
        <p>We added simple filters to the content pane to differentiate between different types of media. Crucially, the filters are context-aware, so they show the type of media that the user is most likely to want to add next based on the current state of the app.</p>
        <p>For example, if the user clicks on the image placeholder inside of their title card (thereby opening the content pane), the pane opens to show only images, like this:</p>
         <div class="standard-image">
            <img alt="The Sway interface with content filters 'All', 'Images', and 'Videos', with 'Images' selected" src="resources/acp-after-image.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>If the user then moves their focus to a video card, the filters change to show only videos.</p>
        <div class="standard-image">
            <img alt="The Sway interface with content filters 'All', 'Images', and 'Videos', with 'Videos' selected" src="resources/acp-after-video.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>If the user wants to browse different types of media, they can escape the filtered view at any time by clicking the "All" filter.</p>
        <p>When implementing the feature, I wanted to make sure that filter switching took place seamlessly, so all filtering is done client-side. A single request is made to the server upon the initial search (just as it was in the old version), so all search results are already loaded on the client; switching filters only determines which pieces of media are shown and which are hidden. This means that switching the filter doesn't incur any latency.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>After releasing the filtering feature, we found that the percentage of Sways where a video was the first piece of content added dropped to 10%. We confirmed through qualitative testing that the experience was much less confusing for users. We even saw a small increase in the percent of users who did a significant number of actions while in the Sway creation experience, indicating that the filtering feature helped to alleviate some frustration and keep users engaged in the process for a longer amount of time.</p>
